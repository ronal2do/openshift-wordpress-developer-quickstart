Popup Builder is a popup plugin for WordPress website that allows you to add highly customizable popup windows. This plugin will enable awesome popup in your WordPress website using short codes. You can add unlimited popups with their own configurations. We added effective settings panel for each popup. So, you can fully customize the popup themes, colors, sizes and many many other options. 

Popups are a good marketing tool, they're impressively high converting. A web page with a popup typically sees more conversions than the same page without a popup. More important, a page with a well designed and thoughtfully implemented popup converts better than one with an ugly popup. With Popup Builder plugin you can customize the popup according to your needs.

Popup Builder team constantly works on upgrades and improvements. With our upcoming updates we are planning to add more types of popups. Currently we are working on

> + Countdown popup - Your site is under construction and you are planing to open it in some amount of time, in this case countdown popup exactly for you. Comming soon.
> + Exit Intent popup - The general theory behind exit popups is fairly simple. Letâ€™s imagine that a user has been browsing through your awesome site, then decides to leave without doing any of the things you want them to do (buying, registering etc). In that moment of indecision we can briefly interrupt them with a popup message, steering them towards a singular call to action. Comming soon.
> + Subsription popup - This kind of popup provides the easiest way to create an efficient connection between users and your website through subscription popup. With this simple popup solution you can quickly collect subscribers in a very pleasant and elegant way. Comming soon.

Thank you for using our popup plugin.
